### Idle configuration
#
# Example configuration:
#
# exec swayidle -w \\
#          timeout 300 'swaylock -f -c 000000' \\
#          timeout 600 'swaymsg \"output * power off\"' resume 'swaymsg \"output * power on\"' \\
#          before-sleep 'swaylock -f -c 000000'
#
# This will lock your screen after 300 seconds of inactivity, then turn off
# your displays after another 300 seconds, and turn your screens back on when
# resumed. It will also lock your screen before your computer goes to sleep.


# You can get the names of your inputs by running: swaymsg -t get_inputs
# Read `man 5 sway-input` for more information about this section.
#
# Status Bar:
#bar {
#    position top
#
#    # When the status_command prints a new line to stdout, swaybar updates.
#    # The default just shows the current date and time.
#    status_command while date +'%Y-%m-%d %l:%M:%S %p'; do sleep 1; done
#
#    colors {
#        statusline #ffffff
#        background #323232
#        inactive_workspace #32323200 #32323200 #5c5c5c
